# Ovim GUI

This directory contains the SolidJS frontend embedded by the `ovim-gui` Tauri
binary. It is a projection of the real Ovim editor state: keyboard, paste,
pointer, picker, tab, and file-tree actions are sent back through the Rust
bridge instead of being reimplemented in JavaScript.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run check
npm run dev
```

The browser development view uses representative mock state. To exercise the
native bridge, build the checked-in production assets and launch through Ovim:

```sh
npm run build
cargo build -p ovim --bins
target/debug/ovim gui README.md
```

`dist/` is intentionally checked in because Cargo embeds it in the native
binary without requiring Node during a Rust build.

### Editor text placement tests

```sh
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium webkit
npm run test:layout
```

These real-browser tests compare segment and glyph positions against continuous
text in Normal and Insert modes, with different cursor and syntax boundaries and
on a line without a cursor. They also verify that font completion updates existing
segments. WebKit covers the macOS GUI's rendering engine; Chromium covers the web
preview. Screenshots are saved under `test-results/`.

### Explorer layout checks

```sh
npm run test:layout -- e2e/explorer-layout.spec.ts
cargo test -p ovim gui::tests --lib --locked
```

The browser scenarios use synthetic filenames to cover deep selection, names
wider than the sidebar, repeated reveal, manual horizontal scrolling, all 420
loaded rows, pointer and keyboard resizing, responsive width clamping, and
workspace persistence. Snapshot-driven workbench scenarios also verify that
reveal activates a hidden Explorer and resizing updates the editor viewport.
Chromium and WebKit save screenshots under `test-results/`. The Rust projection
test verifies that every loaded tree row and repeated reveal intent reach the GUI.

### Native browser smoke test

The debug GUI includes an opt-in end-to-end smoke test for the embedded
browser. It opens two real loopback-backed child webviews, types into a form,
scrolls the page, switches tabs, and verifies that the form value, scroll
position, and editable-focus key mode survive the round trip:

```sh
OVIM_BROWSER_SMOKE=1 cargo run -p ovim --bin ovim-gui
```

A successful run prints `OVIM_BROWSER_SMOKE_OK` and exits with status 0. The
harness is compiled only in debug builds and does not make external network
requests. Operating-system delivery of trusted physical keyboard events still
needs a manual check because macOS automation requires Accessibility access.

## Current boundary

The GUI renders the focused editor pane, tabs, file tree, diagnostics, Git
state, picker, completion, hover, prompts, and status information. Core Ovim
remains authoritative for modes, commands, selections, edits, and persistence.
For `.strok` buffers, a Vector companion tab asks the native bridge to render
the in-memory source with the installed Strøk CLI; its review form drafts
file-specific feedback in the authoritative core AI chat.

Browser tabs are also frontend-specific. `workbench.ts` composes stable source,
Vector, and Browser item identities into one selection model. Their shared
Solid toolbar reserves a measured viewport for the selected native Tauri child
webview; the Rust `BrowserHost` owns the bounded session collection,
active-child visibility, navigation policy, page generations, and DOM
evaluation. UI and AI requests go through that one host, so they cannot race
independent browser implementations. A new manual Browser tab is an unloaded
logical session: no child webview exists until its first navigation. Closing
the tab destroys both. The web development view cannot create browser tabs
because it has no native child-webview primitive.

Colon commands use the reusable `SurfaceCommandLine` with a browser-specific
grammar (`:browser`, `:goto`, `:back`, `:forward`, `:reload`, `:stop`, `:q`, and
workbench tab navigation). `:browser` opens a fresh Browser tab from either a
source or Browser context. The address field and `:goto` accept either a
network address or a DuckDuckGo search. Browser shortcuts, page key requests,
and colon commands all reach the same typed `browserWorkbench` controller; the
toolbar does not own a parallel mutation path. A tokenized initialization
script in the remote child webview can send only a small set of typed intents
after trusted keypresses. It cannot invoke Tauri commands or control Ovim
directly.

The injected key bridge is split by concern under `browser/key_bridge/` and is
initialized in every frame. It synchronizes only the per-tab enabled and
Normal/Insert state across frames; the per-webview command token never enters
that message channel. Focusing an editable field enters Insert mode
automatically, `i` enters it explicitly, and `Esc` blurs an editable and returns
to Normal mode. The toolbar toggle disables unmodified Vim-style keys for that
tab without disabling native app shortcuts such as `Cmd/Ctrl+W`, `Cmd/Ctrl+T`,
or `Cmd/Ctrl+L`.

The AI browser tools are advertised only when this live host is attached and
the active chat profile sets `scope_network = true`; the built-in `codex_sol`
chat profile enables it by default. See
[`user-docs/ai.md`](../../user-docs/ai.md#shared-embedded-browser-ovim-gui) for
the control and security boundary.

Terminal-only surfaces and exact soft-wrap/multi-split layout parity remain
follow-up work; they do not maintain a second editor implementation in the DOM.
